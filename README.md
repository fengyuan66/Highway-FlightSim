# Highway-FlightSim
Flight simulator repository for my Highways project

<h3>Project Description</h3>

This is a piece of hardware that can be used in a flight simulator. In particular, it is the Flight Control Unit (FCU), otherwise known as the autopilot. I tried my best to make its design mimic that of the Airbus A320. This project can be plugged into a computer and communicate with Microsoft Flight Simulator with the help of Mobiflight, a software which helps translate hardware inputs to Microsoft Flight Simulator. Users can configure the aircraft's FCU in the simulator by interacting with their physical counterparts, providing a very accurate simulation. 

The project was simple overall but maximising reallism (finding accurate buttons with LEDs, if not having to 3D print contraptions of your own) was very difficult. In which case, the footprints I chose were a balance between the two. 

The way it works is simple:

1. Hardware input, Arduino send signal to computer
2. Mobiflight translate input according to programed instructions
3. MSFS receives signal and acts.

... or the other way around

1. MSFS sends out signal
2. Mobiflight translates MSFS signal and sends to Arduino according to programed instrictions.
3. Arduino tell components what to do

<h3>Why I built it</h3>

Oh boy there were a lot of reasons why I built it

**1. My school club**

I run an aviation club at school currently and the main attraction is the flight simulator. Currently, it is a humble stick and throttle setup. Over the summer, I aim to expand this flight simulator by adding modular components piece by piece. This will be useful for my club and people will enjoy playing around with it more. Imagine how cool it would be to have a full, professional-looking simulator!

**2. Flight sim market is overpriced**

Many flight simulation hardware are insanely overpriced. For example, this one only took me about 50 USD to make. However, many on-market alternatives (although slightly more realistic) cost above 100 USD. Given that I'm broke, expanding the flight simulator by purchasing even second-handed hardware is not a sustainable solution.

**3. I like aviation!**

Having physical controls over the flight simulator is much better than using a mouse to set the autopilot in-game. This project will boost my experience overall.
